# FinvizChUpTop5

Purpose: This searches for the top 5 entries in Finviz's "Channel Up" category and then appends open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume data (ohlccv, it is also referred to a few times as ohlcv) to a file for that entry, in a folder (also for that entry) that is made if it doesn't exist. Data is appended to the files for 19 days. Files older than 19 days are moved to a file named ".Old".
